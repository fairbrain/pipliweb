                                    available in many Indian house- holds. From making delicious food to curing numerous
                                    diseases, it has been used as an effective option for many years. It is intricately
                                    interwoven with Indian culture and Indians use this oil also to illuminate diyas
                                    during many rituals. Now mustard oil is backed not only by traditional and
                                    experimental knowledge but also by the scientific fraternity for its benefi- cial
                                    properties.

                                <p>Soybean oil is a vegetable oil that’s
                                    extracted from the seeds
                                    of the soybean plant. soyabean oil were produced around the globe, making it one of
                                    the most common cooking oils available It’s also incredibly versatile and can be
                                    used in a variety of cooking methods, including: frying, baking, roasting .Soybean
                                    oil mostly consists of polyunsaturated fats, which are linked to lower cholesterol
                                    levels and a reduced risk of heart disease. Soybean oil is rich in vitamin K, which
                                    may help maintain bone strength and reduce the risk of fractures. Soybean oil
                                    contains omega-3 fatty acids, which play a key role in promoting health and
                                    preventing chronic disease. Soybean oil is rich in vitamin E, a nutrient that can
                                    help promote skin health. Applying it topically may protect against inflammation and
                                    help the skin retain moisture.</p>

                                    most widely used vegetable Oil in the world (Zion Market Research).The awareness
                                    among consumers of the detrimental health effects of consuming foods with trans
                                    fatty acid from partially hydrogenated oils has created greater demand for food

                                    foam and polymerize make us a better frying oil than other liquid oils.
                                    The Excellent Oxidative and prolonged hat stability of Palmolein Oil due to their
                                    fatty acid composition and micro-nutrient content.
                                    The quality of fried foods depends not only on the type of foods and frying
                                    conditions, but also on the oil used for frying. Thus, the selection of stable
                                    frying oils of good quality is of great importance to maintain a low deterioration
                                    during frying and consequently a high quality of the fried foods.

                                    <li>Rice Bran Oil creates less polymers (or is less greasy) than other oils meaning
                                        better flavor and easier clean-up.</li>
                                    <li>The unique property of the RBO is less oil absorption than other commercial
                                        available edible oils which favors the enhanced flavor and palatability. RBO is
                                        good source of mono-unsaturat- ed fats and cholesterol and has been proved to be
                                        effective in reducing LDL (bad cholesterol). The high smoking point prevents
                                        fatty acid breakdown at high temperatures which retains its antioxidant

                                    <li>Rice Bran Oil contains a unique phytochemical called oryzanol. The oryzanol is

                                    <li>It also helps to reduce triglycerides and improves the good cholesterol to bad
                                        cholesterol ratio (HDL/LDL) which is very important for heart health.</li>
